# CreateChunkloading

[![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/create-chunkloading.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-chunkloading)

This is a fork of [Create Integration](https://github.com/LordGrimmauld/createintegration)'s chunk loader, however, the actual chunkloading logic is no longer identical.
The Forge chunk manager is now used to load chunks, which provides improved reliability and less chances of chunks being left forceloaded after you break the contraption.

What makes this chunkloader special is that it will work on a moving Create contraption, and load the chunks necessary for the contraption to move independently of a player.
This provides the potential for fully automatic tunnel bores and other types of automated machinery.
